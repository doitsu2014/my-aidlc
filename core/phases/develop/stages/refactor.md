# Refactoring

## Steps

### Step 1: Justify the refactor

State the debt, its cost, and why now rather than later. Refactors without a
named benefit are rejected.

### Step 2: Establish a safety net

Confirm tests cover the code to be changed. If not, add characterisation tests
first.

### Step 3: Refactor in small steps

Keep behaviour identical. Make one mechanical change at a time and run tests
after each.

### Step 4: Record the change

Write `refactor-notes.md`: what moved, what changed shape, and what stayed the
same.

### Step 5: Complete and confirm

Report `awaiting-approval` and present the gate.
